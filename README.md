# Lnk2Vbs

Python script that embeds VBS into LNK and when executed runs the VBS script from within!

Here we provide all the arguments to the .LNK File. Along with this we also provide the name of the VBS script (should be present in the same directory as the script) to be embedded inside the LNK file.

Once the script execution is completed it generates the LNK File with the embedded VBS script as shown below

Ansd then once we execute the LNK file it runs the embedded VBS Script from within -> which further spawns our favourite "calc.exe" :
